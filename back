        <p>We went to Cuba to learn about young people's attitudes towards climate change and what they wanted to do about it. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In our first exploratory visit, we came face to face with incredible ‘youth leaders’ in Cuba’s environmental sector. The problem is they are scattered all over the country so working together is hard. It doesn’t help that communication and transportation kind of suck.</p><br><br>
        <p>We went back to the drawing table and designed a participatory action research project to explore how youth engage with climate action in Cuba. So off Gioel, Kirsten and Desirae went.</p><br><br>
        <p>Gioel is the Director of Research at Recrear. The Cuba project was born in large part because of her friendship with a Cuban activist named Handy.</p><br><br>
        <p>Kirsten is Recrear’s resident community caretaker. She has spent several years playing with experiential education and youth-friendly techniques.</p><br><br>
        <p>Desirae is a youth specialist who interned with Recrear during the Cuba project; lending her awesome skills in research and writing.</p> <br>
        <p>Training: We selected a group of Cuban youth leaders from each region to train in action research.</p>


        <p>12 workshops: We ran a series of participatory action research workshops with about 75 young people, aged 18-35 in the cities of Havana, Santa Clara and Santiago de Cuba.</p><br>


        <p>Mid-Term Review: We made a point of the situation. We started digesting what we had learned so far.</p><br>


        <p>Internships: Our Cuban researchers began their internships which involved running interviews with more than 30 experts, institutions and community organizations. </p><br>


        <p>Final Review Workshop: We got our group of Cuban researchers back together in the same place to assess what we had collectively learned.</p><br>


        <p>Sharing: We agreed on our lessons learned and shared them via blogs, a photo book of recommendations and in international conferences.</p><br>
