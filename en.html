          <p>
            We are a group of passionate, action-oriented young people from all over the world. We design fun, practical research projects to learn about the experience of other young people. Our aim is to connect with ourselves, each other, and the world around us.
          <br><br>
            Cuba intrigued us because we sensed that young Cubans were… a lot of things. So we created a little <a class="link" href="http://philome.la/randomgutfeelin/cuban-youth/play" target="_blank">word game</a> about it. It all started with a lot of serendipity.

My great passion is literature; I’ve been writing since I was little. I like having good conversations with friends, listening to good music, and taking long walks along the beach. I believe that things start to change when we decide to change them. For this reason, I’ve never liked standing with my arms crossed.</p>

                  <p>Well, actually, this is all wrong.
                  If you get rid of the marabou, what happens?
                  Well, you expose the soil to direct sunlight, stripping it of moisture and nutrients essential for supporting plant and animal life. <br> <br>
                  The Marabou, with its deep roots, helps to reintroduce nitrogen and prevent soil erosion.
                  And this is just the beginning.
                  The plant is also food for many animals. Dead marabou fertilizes the soil, not to mention that the wood is a valuable source of fuel for cooking and heating. <br> <br>
                  The marabou is a central element of its ecosystem.
                  It is integrated into a natural system that relies precisely upon the interconnectedness and interdependence between the elements: the specific combination and variety of vegetation, animal life, soil, water, and climate conditions.
                  If you remove the marabou, well, you completely disturb this natural balance and disrupt the biological cycle</p>

                  <p>Well, once large-scale agro industrial sugarcane production declined some two decades ago in Cuba, the land that had been used to grow the sugarcane was abandoned.
                  Sugarcane farming left unfertile soil behind that was then invaded with the marabou. <br> <br>
                  The dominant view is that the marabou prevents people from using these idle lands and making them cultivable. Ironically enough, the “weed” has actually helped to rejuvenate the land and biodiversity.</p>

                  <p>Well, the marabou is there precisely because you are not farming. The challenge is to realize that everything in nature has a role, even when it seems ‘bad’. The challenge is to grow food sustainably in a way that will maintain and reinforce this natural ecosystem. <br> <br>
                  The philosophy in permaculture is to start by observing all the elements in a specific place (the climate, soil composition, water vegetation, animal life, etc.). <br>
                  Then you try to design a system accounting for and reinforcing the interconnection between all of these elements involved in that particular ecosystem.
                  So what I am saying is that we need to be creative- and make the most of the marabou.</p>

                  <p>Well the problem is that we can’t afford new cars. The cars we have are from the 50s, of course they pollute a lot! If we were able to afford new cars, things would be better. We could introduce a law to limit cars from producing too much pollution, but without a better economy it simply won’t work.</p>

                  <p>Who says that with more economic growth we will have less pollution? We might have better cars, but if we have three times more cars, there will be more pollution and a the city will be more crowded. <br> <br> Plus, the problem is that new cars are designed to have a shorter life span. Yes, we still use cars from the 50s, but how often would we have to change our cars if we could afford new ones? And what kind of environmental damage would be caused by increased consumerism? </p>

              We facilitated a debate in Havana with a group of 25 young people. We divided them into three groups. One group was asking questions, one group was answering, and one group was observing. Participants were asked to put themselves in the shoes of a different character: a journalist from Granma (a local newspaper), an environmentalist, a taxi driver, a housewife, a young musician. The idea was to reflect over how different people relate to the problem of climate change in Cuba.</p>
