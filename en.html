            We are a group of passionate, action-oriented young people from all over the world. We design fun, practical research projects to learn about the experience of other young people. Our aim is to connect with ourselves, each other, and the world around us.
          <br><br>
            With this website we wanted to share our experience working with young people in Cuba. We hope you will enjoy exploring this site!

My greatest passion is literature - I’ve been writing since I was little. I like getting into great conversations with friends, listening to good music, and taking long walks along the beach. I believe that things start to change when we decide to change them. It’s for this reason that I never liked standing with my arms crossed.</p>

            <h1>Chinito and the garden</h1>
            <p>
              Near my dorm there is a little garden. I never really paid attention to it. As I would go and come back from class, always busy, the garden would say hi to me every day. Absorbed in my own world, I barely even noticed. Strangely enough, I finally start paying attention to it, when something really sad happened. One of the gardeners fell ill. It saddened me because he is a sweet, old man who always looks after us in the dorm. I was surprised when, between tears, he was complaining that he would not be able to take care of the garden which had given so much joy to his long life. <br><br>
              He explained how this small place had allowed him to maintain a strong relationship with nature and its fruits. That space took him back to his hometown, to the countryside where he grew up. I realized that there are people that have a much more powerful relationship with nature than I do. <br><br>
              The ‘chinito’ (little Chinese), as he was warmly nicknamed, showed me that subconsciously nature helps us, is our friend, yet we barely give it our time. I reflected about it and I started spending a bit more time in the little garden that is so important to Chinito, who could have easily been my grandfather. Suddenly, everything around me completely changed. <br><br>
              I surrounded myself with all types of medicinal and aromatic plants. I even learned about a banana tree that started waving at me a little branch full of fruit that nobody could touch without the consent from the guardians of the garden. I felt somewhat responsible and yet comforted by this space which had been transformed, by the hands of Chinito and the other custodians, into a productive space. <br><br>
              Chinito proudly explained to me everything that I had never come close enough to see being so caught up with my life. I was lost between the smell of oregano, tilo (a medicinal plant) and mint. I discovered that some of these spices are used to make the food we eat every day in the cafeteria. <br><br>
              I left the garden understanding exactly why Chinito was feeling so down, and I think I am still a bit sad now, writing about this. The love and dedication that he has given to this garden is incomparable –  the willingness to live of this sweet old man, as I tell him, is contained in the garden which he took care of for so long. I believe that now, I will always be aware of the gardem. Maybe I won’t take care of it every day, but I will start giving it a little bit of my time, even if it’s just to say hi. <br><br>

                  <p>Well, actually, this is all wrong.
                  If you get rid of the marabou, what happens?
                  Well, you expose the soil to direct sunlight, stripping it of moisture and nutrients essential for supporting plant and animal life. <br> <br>
                  The Marabou, with its deep roots, helps to reintroduce nitrogen and prevent soil erosion.
                  And this is just the beginning.
                  The plant is also food for many animals. Dead marabou fertilizes the soil, not to mention that the wood is a valuable source of fuel for cooking and heating. <br> <br>
                  The marabou is a central element of its ecosystem.
                  It is integrated into a natural system that relies precisely upon the interconnectedness and interdependence between the elements: the specific combination and variety of vegetation, animal life, soil, water, and climate conditions.
                  If you remove the marabou, well, you completely disturb this natural balance and disrupt the biological cycle</p>

                  <p>Well, once large-scale agro industrial sugarcane production declined some two decades ago in Cuba, the land that had been used to grow the sugarcane was abandoned.
                  Sugarcane farming left unfertile soil behind that was then invaded with the marabou. <br> <br>
                  The dominant view is that the marabou prevents people from using these idle lands and making them cultivable. Ironically enough, the “weed” has actually helped to rejuvenate the land and biodiversity.</p>

                  <p>Well, the marabou is there precisely because you are not farming. The challenge is to realize that everything in nature has a role, even when it seems ‘bad’. The challenge is to grow food sustainably in a way that will maintain and reinforce this natural ecosystem. <br> <br>
                  The philosophy in permaculture is to start by observing all the elements in a specific place (the climate, soil composition, water vegetation, animal life, etc.).
                  <br><br>
                  Then you try to design a system accounting for and reinforcing the interconnection between all of these elements involved in that particular ecosystem. So what I am saying is that we need to be creative- and make the most of the marabou.</p>

                  <p>Well the problem is that we can’t afford new cars. The cars we have are from the 50s, of course they pollute a lot! If we were able to afford new cars, things would be better. We could introduce a law to limit cars from producing too much pollution, but without a better economy it simply won’t work.</p>

                  <p>Who says that with more economic growth we will have less pollution? We might have better cars, but if we have three times more cars, there will be more pollution and a the city will be more crowded. <br> <br> Plus, the problem is that new cars are designed to have a shorter life span. Yes, we still use cars from the 50s, but how often would we have to change our cars if we could afford new ones? And what kind of environmental damage would be caused by increased consumerism? </p>

              We facilitated a debate in Havana with a group of 25 young people. We divided them into three groups. One group was asking questions, one group was answering, and one group was observing. Participants were asked to put themselves in the shoes of a different character: a journalist from Granma (a local newspaper), an environmentalist, a taxi driver, a housewife, a young musician. The idea was to reflect over how different people relate to the problem of climate change in Cuba.</p>

                <h1>Community Map</h1>
                <p>Imagine your community. Draw it out in the way you see it in your mind's eye. It doesn't have to be to scale! Then draw hearts over the places that are environmentally conscious and x's over the places where there's neglect.</p>

                  Projecting people's individual and collective experience in community in this way allows us to very visually see the invisible social fabric at play. For us, it was a great way to learn about great environmental initiatives happening in each city while also highlighting spots of neglect.

                  We did this exercise using freeze frames to bring some of their interpretations to life. What we found is that Cuba's past generation had a stronger relationship to nature even though they were not versed in today's generation of climate talk.
